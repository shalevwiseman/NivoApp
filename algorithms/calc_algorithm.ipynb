    "My friend, who is a pilot, has asked me for help in creating a software application. The goal is to track his flights and calculate the payment he should receive from his employer each month. The software will allow him to manually enter important flight details such as the takeoff date, takeoff time, takeoff airport, landing date, landing time, landing airport, and any additional notes. We will store this data in a CSV file for easy management.\n",

    "The following script generates random flight details and prints them in a comma-separated format. Here's an explanation of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing Modules:\n",
    "   - `random`: Provides functions for generating random numbers.\n",
    "   - `datetime` and `timedelta` from the `datetime` module: Used for working with dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining the `generate_mission()` Function:\n",
    "   - This function randomly selects a mission type (either \"pilot\" or \"passenger\") based on the provided weights.\n",
    "   - Returns the chosen mission type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defining the `generate_random_details(N)` Function:\n",
    "   - This function generates a list of flight details.\n",
    "   - Parameters:\n",
    "     - `N`: Number of flight details to generate.\n",
    "   - Variables:\n",
    "     - `airports`: A list of European airport codes.\n",
    "     - `details`: An empty list to store the generated flight details.\n",
    "   - Generating the First Set of Details:\n",
    "     - `takeoff_date`: Current date minus 120 days.\n",
    "     - `takeoff_time`: Current date with the time set to midnight plus a random number of minutes between 0 and 1439.\n",
    "     - `takeoff_airport`: Randomly selects an airport from the `airports` list or uses \"LLBG\" with a higher weight.\n",
    "   - Generating Flight Details:\n",
    "     - Iterates `N` times.\n",
    "     - `landing_timestamp`: Adds a random number of hours (between 1 and 6) to the `takeoff_time` to get the landing timestamp.\n",
    "     - Extracts the landing date and time from the `landing_timestamp`.\n",
    "     - `landing_airport`: Randomly selects an airport from the `airports` list as the landing airport.\n",
    "     - Adds the flight details as a dictionary to the `details` list.\n",
    "     - Generates the next takeoff date by adding a random number of days (between 1 and 3) to the `landing_date`.\n",
    "     - Generates a new `takeoff_time` using the `takeoff_date` and a random number of minutes.\n",
    "     - Randomly selects a new `takeoff_airport` from the `airports` list or uses \"LLBG\" with a higher weight.\n",
    "   - Returns the generated flight details as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generating Random Details:\n",
    "   - Calls the `generate_random_details()` function with `N = 30` to generate a list of 30 flight details.\n",
    "   - Assigns the result to the `random_details` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Flight Details:\n",
    "   - Iterates over each `details` dictionary in `random_details`.\n",
    "   - Prints the values of each detail, joined by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script generates random flight details including takeoff date, takeoff time, takeoff airport, landing date, landing time, landing airport, and mission type. These details are then printed in a comma-separated format.\n"
